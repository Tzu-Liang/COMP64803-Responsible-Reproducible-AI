This program calculates the distance of a high-redshift object by implementing a numerical integral solver using Simpson's Rule.

The program assumes a Lambda-CDM cosmology with assumed density parameters of mass, lambda, and curvature taking the values of 0.28, 0.72, and 0 respectively.

All formulas used to calculate distance in this program are taken from Distance Measures in Cosmology (2000), by David W. Hogg.
